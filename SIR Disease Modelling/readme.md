## Introduction
The SIR model or Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model is a mathematical model that is widely used in the study of how diseases spread through populations. 
SIR model describes the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak over time. 
Understanding the dynamics of such outbreaks has been crucial for implementing effective control measures. 
To address this challenge, mathematicians have developed the SIR model, 
a powerful tool that simplifies the complex processes of disease transmission into a set of mathematical equations. 
By analyzing these equations and the resulting model outputs, we gain valuable insights into how diseases spread within a population, 
allowing us to predict outbreak trends and inform public health interventions. 
## Basics
The model works by dividing the entire population into three categories: 
1. **Susceptible (S):** Individuals who are unaffected now but are vulnerable to getting infected 
2. **Infectious (I):** Individuals who are currently infected and are able to spread the disease 
3. **Recovered or Removed (R):** Individuals who have recovered from the disease or who have passed away from the disease. 
The model then traces the movement of individuals between these compartments over time, 
typically measured in days or weeks to provide valuable insights about the spread of the disease
