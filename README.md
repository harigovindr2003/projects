This repository showcases the projects that I have completed. Feel free to check them out.

## advanced data analysis projects üìà
1. [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/harigovindr2003/projects/tree/main/House%20Prices%20-%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques): Obtained the data from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition. Processed and prepared the data by handling missing values, log transforming skewed features, and encoding categorical variables. After training a multiple linear regression model on the training data. The data was found to have a good fit, then this model was used to predict the `SalesPrice` (target variable) in the test data, the test data predictions were submitted to Kaggle and achieved a public score of 0.16670 (RMSLE). While this is a solid baseline, future improvements could include advanced feature engineering and more advanced models like ensemble methods which could further improve the score.

## python projects üêç
1. [SIR Disease Modeling: A Mathematical Approach using Python](https://github.com/harigovindr2003/projects/tree/main/SIR%20Disease%20Modeling): Modeling the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model of
disease spread using mathematical methods in python.
2. [Exam Practice Tracker](https://github.com/harigovindr2003/projects/tree/main/Exam%20Practice%20Tracker): A tool for tracking your exam practice progress, including time, accuracy, and scores across different sections and questions.

## power query & excel üìä
1. [Cyclistic Case Study](https://github.com/harigovindr2003/projects/tree/main/Cyclistic%20Case%20Study): Capstone project in Google Data Analytics Professional Certification program. Analysed large data to make visualisations and to find strategies to increase the membership.
