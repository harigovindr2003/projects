### Objective
The goal of the project is to build a model that predicts house prices based on a set of features. We will be working with the data [House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques](). 

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains details about houses and their sale prices. We obtain the data from the following CSV files:
1. **train.csv** - This dataset contains features of houses along with their sale price (the target variable we need to predict).
2. **test.csv** – This dataset contains houses with the same features, but without the sale price. You'll need to predict these values.
3. **data_description.txt** – A text file explaining each feature in the dataset.

### Model Evaluation
Using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), we can evaluate the accuracy of the model. It checks for the presence of large errors in the predicted prices.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Load the data in Python using **pandas**
